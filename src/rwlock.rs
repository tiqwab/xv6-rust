/// A reader-writer lock
///
/// This type of lock allows a number of readers or at most one writer at any
/// point in time. The write portion of this lock typically allows modification
/// of the underlying data (exclusive access) and the read portion of this lock
/// typically allows for read-only access (shared access).
///
/// The type parameter `T` represents the data that this lock protects. It is
/// required that `T` satisfies `Send` to be shared across tasks and `Sync` to
/// allow concurrent access through readers. The RAII guards returned from the
/// locking methods implement `Deref` (and `DerefMut` for the `write` methods)
/// to allow access to the contained of the lock.
///
/// An [`RwLockUpgradeableGuard`](RwLockUpgradeableGuard) can be upgraded to a
/// writable guard through the [`RwLockUpgradeableGuard::upgrade`](RwLockUpgradeableGuard::upgrade)
/// [`RwLockUpgradeableGuard::try_upgrade`](RwLockUpgradeableGuard::try_upgrade) functions.
/// Writable or upgradeable guards can be downgraded through their respective `downgrade`
/// functions.
///
/// Based on Facebook's
/// [`folly/RWSpinLock.h`](https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/a0394d84f2d5c3e50ebfd0566f9d3acb52cfab5a/folly/synchronization/RWSpinLock.h).
/// This implementation is unfair to writers - if the lock always has readers, then no writers will
/// ever get a chance. Using an upgradeable lock guard can *somewhat* alleviate this issue as no
/// new readers are allowed when an upgradeable guard is held, but upgradeable guards can be taken
/// when there are existing readers. However if the lock is that highly contended and writes are
/// crucial then this implementation may be a poor choice.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use spin;
///
/// let lock = spin::RwLock::new(5);
///
/// // many reader locks can be held at once
/// {
///     let r1 = lock.read();
///     let r2 = lock.read();
///     assert_eq!(*r1, 5);
///     assert_eq!(*r2, 5);
/// } // read locks are dropped at this point
///
/// // only one write lock may be held, however
/// {
///     let mut w = lock.write();
///     *w += 1;
///     assert_eq!(*w, 6);
/// } // write lock is dropped here
